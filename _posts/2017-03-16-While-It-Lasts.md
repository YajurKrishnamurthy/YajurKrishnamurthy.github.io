(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, over the course of the lesson and the homework I have figured out how to use them quite well.</td>

    <td>What we did in the lesson was quite interesting, we started of by trying to figure out how we would make a random number generator. This generator would have to pick a number between 1-10. Then the user would take a guess. If the user was wrong the machine would say guess again. Then if wrong again, the machine would say guess again and etc. etc.. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think again, we had very little time at the end of the lesson to try and create this code. That means that all of that and other worksheets were homework. That is quite a lot considering that the 1-10 generator isn't that easy to create.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Again, I will listen more and make sure to try and understand what has been said and get as much as possible done.</td>
