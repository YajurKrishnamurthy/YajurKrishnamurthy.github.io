    <td>I learned how to use Github effectively. I also learned how to use add-ons in Google applications. In this lesson, listening and following instructions strictly and correctly was key. If i hadn't taken good notes, my blog could have not worked or there could have been other problems. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think some things that limited my learning in this lesson were talking to my friends. Another smaller thing was that sometimes there was nothing to do. We were asked to follow specific instructions and since we finished before lots of other people, for a short amount of time I was just waiting for others to finish so our teacher could give us the next instructions on how to create our blog.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As for next time, I think i will talk less and make sure I am more careful and quicker with my work. I think it may be harder next lesson so I may need to concentrate a little bit more to make sure completely that I do not make any mistakes. </td>
