    <td> My learning is very good when I am helping others and we are working together. This way we trade cool things that we can do and give honest opinions about each other's blog. This is particularly useful because our friends sopt out things they don't like about the blog which you havenâ€™t noticed like contrasting colours and small things like the size of text.                                                                                                                                        </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some things that may have limited my learning is using available sources. Instead of using W3Schools and Google, I just played around a bit until, I got what I wanted. I could have saved some time just searching for whatever I wanted instead of wasting time testing things. I am going to do that next lesson to be able to achieve more things in less time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning, if I know exactly what I want to do with my blog, instead of testing things I will go straight to W3Schools and other reliable sources. This will make me more efficient and help my blog progress. Also, I think choosing the right colour scheme is key and once that is done, a lot of time will be saved.</td>
