    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have a website with colours, avatars and a site name.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To add tables so my site looks nice and organised.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I have added some good-looking tables and it has organised my site.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Again, taking some notes were key but I think using my own resources was the most useful. I used sites like W3Schools to help me build the tables in my site. This was useful because it gave me the necessary tips and code to allow me to put padding, double lines and many more features. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again, I think I worked pretty well last lesson but one thing I could work on it getting a little bit more things done in the lesson to move ahead of the other kids in my class. For example, when reading through the W3Schools website I got distracted by what the person next to me was doing and then I would go back to my work. This could be a problem because it will eventually slow me down and then I will fall behind and will have to do a lot of catching up for homework instead of doing it in the lesson when we were supposed to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think next lesson I will want to listen carefully and follow the instructions sos that I don't make any mistakes. Plus I will make sure I do not get distracted by the other people sitting around me and what they are doing with their blog posts. This will help me gain speed in my work and be able to perform tasks to the best of my ability.
