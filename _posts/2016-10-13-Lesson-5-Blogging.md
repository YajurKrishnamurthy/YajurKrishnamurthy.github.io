  <tr>
    <td>I learned by listening carefully to everything that was said. This was really important because any small mistake could completely ruin the spreadsheet. Also taking pictures so I don't forget anything would be really useful. When working on my spreadsheet this is really helpful.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the only thing that limited my learning not being able to understand what was being said because the teacher was going very quickly. I think if he slowed down a bit sometimes it would be useful and can help me a lot with my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think for next time, I will ask the teacher to slow down for bits that I do not understand fully. This means that I will definitely understand everything that happens in the lesson and I can get the homework done very quickly. This will also advance my understanding my knowledge of spreadsheets.</td>
