  <tr>
    <td>Mr Tansley is a chilled teacher. I have learned more about Python and repl.it. I have learned that IT is more difficult with Mr Keen as your teacher.  I have learned that making your blog look good is actually satisfying. I think I have found this final half term of IT very good. I have really enjoyed everything. My favourite topic we did in the last 2 years has got to be spreadsheets.</td>
