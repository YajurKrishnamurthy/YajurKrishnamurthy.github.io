    <td>I have a very basic website with no colours or interesting features</td>

    <td>To have reconfigured the look of my website.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I managed to add colours, an avatar and a name.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> I took lots of notes and listened carefully did what I was told so that I didn't make any mistakes. I realised that paying particular detail to some things means you can do some things which other people didn’t realise they could do. For example, I was the first person to find out you could a GIF as your avatar which was quite cool.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I did the work set very quickly so to be honest there's not much I could improve on. I think one thing to improve on is to spent less time choosing nice GIFs and changing the actual website look.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Like I said in the paragraph above, I think to improve, I will do more different things during the lesson instead of spending lots of time on 1 thing. I think the last lesson was pretty good so there isn’t much to improve.</td>
